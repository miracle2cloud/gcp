Getting help in Unix

Unix Shell Commands
clear – clear screen
history – show history of previous commands

Time and Date commands
date – show current date and time
sleep – wait for a given number of seconds
uptime – find out how long the system has been up

Unix users commands
These commands allow you to get basic information about Unix users in your environment.

whoami – show your username
id – print user identity
groups – show which groups user belongs to
passwd – change user password
who – find out who is logged into the system
last – show history of logins into the system
Unix file operations
Navigating filesystem and managing files and access permissions:

ls – list files and directories
cp – copy files (work in progress)
rm – remove files and directories (work in progress)
mv – rename or move files and directories to another location
chmod – change file/directory access permissions
chown – change file/directory ownership
Text file operations in Unix
Most of important configuration in Unix is in clear text files, these commands will let you quickly inspect files or view logs:

cat – concatenate files and show contents to the standard output
more – basic pagination when viewing text files or parsing Unix commands output
less – an improved pagination tool for viewing text files (better than more command)
head – show the first 10 lines of text file (you can specify any number of lines)
tail – show the last 10 lines of text file (any number can be specified)
grep – search for patterns in text files
Unix directory management commands
Navigating filesystems and managing directories:

cd – change directory
pwd – confirm current directory
ln – make links and symlinks to files and directories
mkdir – make new directory
rmdir – remove directories in Unix
Unix system status commands
Most useful commands for reviewing hostname configuration and vital stats:

hostname – show or set server hostname
w – display system load, who’s logged in and what they are doing
uname – print Unix system information
Reboot
shutdown – graceful shutdown and reboot of your system
halt – ungraceful (without stopping OS services) shutdown
reboot – ungraceful reboot (without stopping OS services)
Networking commands in Unix
Most useful commands for inspecting network setup and exploring network connections and ports:

ifconfig – show and set IP addresses (found almost everywhere)
ip – show and set IP addresses (in recent Linux versions)
ping – check if remote host is reachable via ICMP ping
netstat – show network stats and routing information
Process management
Listing processes and confirming their status, and stopping processes if needed:

ps – list processes
top – show tasks and system status
kill – kill a process (stop application running)
Remote access commands
ssh is really the only way to go, but it’s important to know telnet as well:

telnet – clear-text (insecure) remote access protocol
ssh – Secure SHell – encrypted remote access client
check out the SSH reference!
File transfers commands
Always useful to know how to copy files between servers or just download some package from the web:

ftp – clear-text (insecure!) File Transfer Protocol client
sftp – secure (encrypted) version of FTP
scp – secure (encrypted) version of cp command
wget – download files from remote servers, HTTP/HTTPS and FTP

Unix file operations
basename – get filename from the full path (remove directory names)
ln – make links and symlinks to files and directories
find – finding files and directories in Unix
rsync - synchronise local and remote directories and files

Unix system status commands
dmesg – show latest kernel buffer messages
last – show history of user logins and reboot/shutdown commands
w – show who is logged on and what they are doing
who -r – confirm current run-level of your Unix/Linux OS
uname – print Unix system information: hostname, kernel version, etc
lsb_release – find Linux Standard Base (LSB) information

Privileged Access
su – switch user (commonly used to become root)
sudo – run commands with elevated (usually root-like) privileges
be sure to check out sudo reference
visudo – edit the /etc/sudoers file safely

Advanced process management in Unix
ps -aef – show full listing of processes on your system
ptree – show process tree in Solaris (can be done with ps in Linux)
kill – kill a process (or send a specific signal to it)
nice – start a process with certain priority (CPU resourcing)
renice – update a CPU priority of an existing process
pmap – print process map – detailed low-level memory usage
pfiles – shows list of files/network ports open by process in Solaris

Text Manipulation commands
awk – text processing and data extraction in text files
grep – find and extract lines from text
egrep – extended grep – advanced pattern matching in text files
sed – stream editor (search/replace values in a string)
tr – translate characters in a string using provided rules

Unix filesystems commands
fstyp – confirm a type of filesystem on the specified device
df – shows filesystem usage for active (mounted) filesystems
du – shows disk usage info for files and directories
Working with disks and filesystems
mount – attach filesystem into the file tree
umount – detach filesystem from the file tree
dd – copy or securely erase disks and disk partitions
fsck – check filesystem integrity
growfs – grow filesystem
tune2fs – adjust tunable filesystem parameters (for ext2/ext3)
mkfs – make new filesystem

Networking
iptables – manage firewall rules on a Linux server
netstat – network statistics and network routing information
traceroute – tracing ICMP routes to a remote host
